Joshua Poe has received national recognition as an urban geographer and scholar activist. Originally from Eastern Kentucky and directly impacted by poverty, incarceration, homelessness, and addiction, he began his career doing grassroots organizing around housing, labor, and economic justice issues in Seattle, WA in the late 1990s. He has over 20 years experience researching housing justice, gentrification, and forced displacement. In 2017 he authored and published the interactive storymap, Redlining Louisville: The History of Race, Class, and Housing in Louisville, KY, which received recognition from Harvardâ€™s Kennedy School of Government in its effort to recognize best-in-class data visualizations. He is a pioneer in documenting and exposing how city planning was weaponized as a tool to deny Black people land ownership and access to the accumulation of generational wealth. His work on the history of city planning, root cause analysis and gentrification/displacement makes him a featured speaker nationally. He is currently attending the Methodologies of Housing Justice Summer Institute at UCLA's Institute on Inequality and Democracy.

His maps, data analysis, and research have been featured in the work of the Kresge Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the National League of Cities, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, CityLab, the Urban Equity Lab, as well as a host of local and national academic, research, public policy and planning organizations.
